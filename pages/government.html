<h2>
    According to the Constitution of India, Sikkim has a parliamentary system of representative democracy for its governance;<br>
     universal suffrage is granted to state residents.<br>
     <br>
     The government structure is organised into three branches:<br>
     <br>
    Executive: As with all states of India, a governor stands at the head of the executive power of state,<br>
     just as the president is the head of the executive power in the Union, and is appointed by the President of India.<br>
    The governor's appointment is largely ceremonial, and his or her main role is to oversee the swearing-in of the chief minister.<br>
     The chief minister, who holds the real executive powers, is the head of the party or coalition garnering<br>
    the largest majority in the state elections. The governor also appoints cabinet ministers on the advice of the chief minister.<br>
    <br>
    Legislature: Sikkim has a unicameral legislature, the Sikkim Legislative Assembly, like most other Indian states.<br>
     Its state assembly has 32 seats, including one reserved for the Sangha.<br>
      Sikkim is allocated one seat in each of the two chambers of India's national bicameral legislature, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.<br>
      <br>
    Judiciary: The judiciary consists of the Sikkim High Court and a system of lower courts.<br>
     The High Court, located at Gangtok, has a Chief Justice along with two permanent justices.<br>
      The Sikkim High Court is the smallest state high court in the country.<br>
      <br>
    In 1975, after the abrogation of Sikkim's monarchy, the Indian National Congress gained a majority in the 1977 elections.<br>
     In 1979, after a period of instability, a popular ministry headed by Nar Bahadur Bhandari,<br>
      leader of the Sikkim Sangram Parishad Party, was sworn in.<br>
      Bhandari held on to power in the 1984 and 1989 elections.<br>
       In the 1994 elections, Pawan Kumar Chamling of the Sikkim Democratic Front<br>
        became the Chief Minister of the state. Chamling and his party had since held on to power<br>
         by winning the 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2014 elections.<br>
         However, the 2019 legislative assembly elections were won by the Sikkim<br>
          Krantikari Morcha party and the chief minister since then is Prem Singh Tamang.<br>
           The current Governor of Sikkim is Lakshman Acharya.<br>

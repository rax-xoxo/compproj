The hills of Sikkim mainly consist of gneiss and schist which weather<BR>
 to produce generally poor and shallow brown clay soils. The soil is coarse,<BR>
  with large concentrations of iron oxide; it ranges from neutral to acidic<BR>
   and is lacking in organic and mineral nutrients. This type of soil tends<BR>
    to support evergreen and deciduous forests.<BR>
        <BR>
    The rock consists of phyllites and schists,<BR>
     and is highly susceptible to weathering and erosion.<BR>
      This, combined with the state's heavy rainfall,<BR>
       causes extensive soil erosion and the loss of soil nutrients through leaching.<BR>
        As a result, landslides are frequent, often isolating rural towns<BR>
         and villages from the major urban centres.<br>

<h2>
  Sikkim is situated in an ecological hotspot of the lower Himalayas,<br>
   one of only three among the ecoregions of India.<br>
   The forested regions of the state exhibit a diverse range of fauna and flora.<br>
    Owing to its altitudinal gradation, the state has a wide variety of plants,<br>
     from tropical species to temperate, alpine and tundra ones,<br>
      and is perhaps one of the few regions to exhibit such a diversity within such a small area.<br>
       Nearly 81 per cent of the area of Sikkim comes under the administration of its forest department.<br>
       <br>
  Sikkim is home to around 5,000 species of flowering plants, 515 rare orchids,<br>
   60 primula species, 36 rhododendron species, 11 oak varieties, 23 bamboo varieties,<br>
    16 conifer species, 362 types of ferns and ferns allies, 8 tree ferns, and over 900 medicinal plants.<br>
     A relative of the Poinsettia, locally known as "Christmas Flower", can be found in abundance in the mountainous state.<br>
      The Noble Dendrobium is the official flower of Sikkim, while the rhododendron is the state tree.<br>
      <br>
  Orchids, figs, laurel, bananas, sal trees and bamboo grow<br>
   in the Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests of the lower altitudes of Sikkim.<br>
    In the temperate elevations above 1,500 metres (4,900 ft) there are Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests,<br>
     where oaks, chestnuts, maples, birches, alders, and magnolias grow in large numbers,<br>
      as well as Himalayan subtropical pine forests, dominated by Chir pine.<br>
       Alpine-type vegetation is typically found between an altitude of 3,500 to 5,000 metres (11,500 to 16,400 ft).<br>
        In lower elevations are found juniper, pine, firs, cypresses and<br>
         rhododendrons from the Eastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests.<br>
          Higher up are Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows and high-altitude wetlands,<br>
           which are home to a wide variety of rhododendrons and wildflowers.<br>
  
           <br>
  The fauna of Sikkim include the snow leopard,[74] musk deer, Himalayan tahr,<br>
   red panda, Himalayan marmot, Himalayan serow, Himalayan goral, muntjac,<br>
    common langur, Asian black bear, clouded leopard,[75] marbled cat, leopard cat,<br>
     dhole, Tibetan wolf, hog badger, binturong, and Himalayan jungle cat.<br>
      Among the animals more commonly found in the alpine zone are yaks,<br>
       mainly reared for their milk, meat, and as a beast of burden.<br>
       <br>
  The avifauna of Sikkim include the impeyan pheasant,<br>
   crimson horned pheasant, snow partridge, Tibetan snowcock,<br>
    bearded vulture and griffon vulture, as well as golden eagles, quails,<br>
     plovers, woodcocks, sandpipers, pigeons, Old World flycatchers, babblers and robins.<br>
      Sikkim has more than 550 species of birds, some of which have been declared endangered.<br>
      <br>
  Sikkim also has a rich diversity of arthropods, many of which remain unstudied.<br>
   Some of the most understudied species are Sikkimese arthropods, specifically butterflies.<br>
    Of the approximately 1,438 butterfly species found in the Indian subcontinent,<br>
     695 have been recorded in Sikkim. These include the endangered Kaiser-i-hind,<br>
      the Yellow Gorgon and the Bhutan Glory.<br>

The Lepchas are considered to be the earliest inhabitants of Sikkim.<br>
However the Limbus and the Magars also lived in the inaccessible parts of West and <br>
South districts as early as the Lepchas perhaps lived in the East and North districts.<br>
The Buddhist saint Padmasambhava, also known as Guru Rinpoche,<br>
is said to have passed through the land in the 8th century.<br>
The Guru is reported to have blessed the land, introduced Buddhism, <br>
and foretold the era of monarchy that would arrive in Sikkim centuries later.<br>

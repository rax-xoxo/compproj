    <H1>CLIMATE</H1><h2>
    The state has five seasons: winter, summer, spring, autumn, and monsoon season.<br>
     Sikkim's climate ranges from sub-tropical in the south to tundra in the north.<br>
      Most of the inhabited regions of Sikkim experience a temperate climate,<br>
       with temperatures seldom exceeding 28 °C (82 °F) in summer.<br>
       The average annual temperature for most of Sikkim is around 18 °C (64 °F).<br>
       <br>
    Sikkim is one of the few states in India to receive regular snowfall.<br>
     The snow line ranges from 6,100 metres (20,000 ft) in the south<br>
      of the state to 4,900 metres (16,100 ft) in the north.<br>
       The tundra-type region in the north is snowbound for four months every year,<br>
        and the temperature drops below 0 °C (32 °F) almost every night.<br>
         In north-western Sikkim, the peaks are frozen year-round; because of the high altitude,<br>
          temperatures in the mountains can drop to as low as −40 °C (−40 °F) in winter.<br>
          <br>
    During the monsoon, heavy rains increase the risk of landslides.<br>
     The record for the longest period of continuous rain in Sikkim is 11 days.<br>
      Fog affects many parts of the state during winter and the monsoons, making transportation perilous.<br>

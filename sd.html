  Sikkim has six districts â€“ Gangtok District, Mangan District, Namchi District,<br>
Pakyong District, Geyzing District and Soreng District.<br>
The district capitals are Gangtok, Mangan, Namchi, Pakyong, Gyalshing and Soreng respectively.<br>
These six districts are further divided into 16 subdivisions; Pakyong, Rongli,<br>
Rangpo and Gangtok are the subdivisions of the Gangtok and Pakyong Districts.<br>
Soreng, Yuksom, Gyalshing and Dentam are the subdivisions of the Geyzing and Soreng district.<br>
Chungthang, Dzongu, Kabi and Mangan are the subdivisions of the Mangan district.<br>
Ravongla, Jorethang, Namchi and Yangyang are the subdivisions of the Namchi district.<br>
<br>
Each of Sikkim's districts is overseen by a state government appointee, the district collector,<br>
who is in charge of the administration of the civilian areas of the district.<br>
The Indian Army has control over a large part of the state, <br>
as Sikkim forms part of a sensitive border area with China.<br>
Many areas are restricted to foreigners, and official permits are needed to visit them.<br>

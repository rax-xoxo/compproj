According to legend, Khye Bumsa, a 14th-century prince from the Minyak House in Kham in eastern Tibet,<br>
 received a divine revelation instructing him to travel south to seek his fortunes.<br>
  A fifth-generation descendant of Khye Bumsa, Phuntsog Namgyal,<br>
became the founder of Sikkim's monarchy in 1642,<br>
 when he was consecrated as the first Chogyal, or priest-king,<br>
  of Sikkim by the three venerated lamas at Yuksom.<br>
   Phuntsog Namgyal was succeeded in 1670 by his son, <br>
   Tensung Namgyal, who moved the capital from Yuksom to Rabdentse (near modern Pelling).<br>
    In 1700, Sikkim was invaded by the Bhutanese with the help of the half-sister of the Chogyal,<br>
    who had been denied the throne. The Bhutanese were driven away by the Tibetan people,<br>
    who restored the throne to the Chogyal ten years later. Between 1717 and 1733,<br>
    the kingdom faced many raids by the Nepalese in the west and Bhutanese in the east,<br>
    culminating with the destruction of the capital Rabdentse by the Nepalese.<br>
    In 1791,China sent troops to support Sikkim and defend Tibet against the Gorkha Kingdom.<br>
    Following the subsequent defeat of Gorkha, the Chinese Qing dynasty established control over Sikkim.<br>

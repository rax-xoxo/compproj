    Situated in the Himalayan mountains, the state of Sikkim is characterised by mountainous terrain.<BR>
     Almost the entire state is hilly, with an elevation ranging from 280 metres (920 ft) in the south at the border<BR>
      with West Bengal to 8,586 metres (28,169 ft) in northern peaks near Nepal and Tibet.<br>
       The summit of Kangchenjunga, the world's third-highest peak, is the state's highest point,situated on the border between Sikkim and Nepal.<br>
        For the most part, the land is unfit for agriculture because of the rocky,<BR>
         precipitous slopes. However, some hill slopes have been converted into terrace farms.<BR>

<BR>
    Sikkim is in lower center of image of the Tibetan Plateau- (NASA Satellite photo).<BR>
    Numerous snow-fed streams have carved out river valleys in the west and south of the state.<BR>
     These streams combine into the major Teesta River and its tributary,<BR>
      the Rangeet, which flow through the state from north to south.<BR>
       About a third of the state is heavily forested. The Himalayan mountains surround the northern,<BR>
        eastern and western borders of Sikkim.<BR> 
        The Lower Himalayas, lying in the southern reaches of the state,<BR>
         are the most densely populated.<BR>

     One could see more concentration of glaciers at the north-western part of Sikkim around Kangchenjunga (28,168 ft).<BR>
    The state has 28 mountain peaks, more than 80 glaciers,[59] 227 high-altitude lakes (including the Tsongmo,<BR>
     Gurudongmar and Khecheopalri Lakes), five major hot springs, and more than 100 rivers and streams.<BR>
      Eight mountain passes connect the state to Tibet, Bhutan and Nepal.<br>
    <BR>
    Sikkim's hot springs are renowned for their medicinal and therapeutic value.<BR>
     Among the state's most notable hot springs are those at Phurchachu, Yumthang, Borang, Ralang, Taram-chu and Yumey Samdong.<BR>
      The springs, which have a high sulphur content, are located near river banks; some are known to emit hydrogen.<BR>
       The average temperature of the water in these hot springs is 50 °C (122 °F).<BR>

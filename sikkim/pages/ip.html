        INDIAN PROTECTORATE
    </h1>
    <BR>
    <h2>
    Prior to Indian independence, Jawaharlal Nehru, as the Vice-President of the Executive Council,<br>
     pushed through a resolution in the Indian Constituent Assembly to the effect that Sikkim and Bhutan,<br>
      as Himalayan states, were not 'Indian states' and their future should be negotiated separately.<br>
       A standstill agreement was signed in February 1948.<br>
       <br>
    Meanwhile, Indian independence and its move to democracy spurred a fledgling political movement in Sikkim,<br>
     giving rise to the formation of Sikkim State Congress (SSC), a pro-accession political party.<br>
      The party sent a plate of demands to the palace, including a demand for accession to India.<br>
       The palace attempted to defuse the movement by appointing three secretaries from the SSC<br>
        to the government and sponsoring a counter-movement in the name of Sikkim National Party,<br>
        which opposed accession to India.<br>
        <br>
    The demand for responsible government continued and the SSC launched a civil disobedience movement.<br>
     The Chogyal Palden Thondup Namgyal asked India for help in quelling the movement,<br>
      which was offered in the form of a small military police force and an Indian Dewan.<br>
       In 1950, a treaty was agreed between India and Sikkim which gave Sikkim the status of an Indian protectorate.<br>
       Sikkim came under the suzerainty of India, which controlled its external affairs, defence, diplomacy and communications.<br>
       In other respects, Sikkim retained administrative autonomy.<br>
       <br>
    A state council was established in 1953 to allow for constitutional government under the Chogyal.<br>
     Despite pressures from an India "bent on annexation", Chogyal Palden Thondup Namgyal was able to preserve autonomy <br>
     and shape a "model Asian state" where the literacy rate and per capita income were twice as high as neighbouring Nepal,<br>
      Bhutan and India.[44] Meanwhile, the Sikkim National Congress demanded fresh elections and greater representation for Nepalisin Sikkim.<br>
        People marched on the palace against the monarchy.<br>
         In 1973, anti-royalist riots took place in front of the Chogyal's palace.<br>

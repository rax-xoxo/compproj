    According to the 2011 census, 57.8% follow Hinduism, making it the state's majority religion.<BR>
        Buddhism is followed by 27.4% of the population, while Christianity is followed by 9.9%.<BR> 
        Between 2001 and 2011, Christianity was the fastest growing religion in the state, <BR> 
       going from 6.67% to 9.91% of the population.<BR> 
        It was thus the fourth state with the highest Christian growth in the period, behind <BR> 
       only Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Meghalaya.<BR> 
       As of 2014, the Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Sikkim is the largest Christian denomination in Sikkim.<BR> 
       Hinduism, on the other hand, declined from 60.93% to 57.76% of the population in the same period.<BR> 
       Sikkim was the fourth state with the biggest decline in the percentage of Hindus, <BR> behind only Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Assam.<BR>  Vajrayana Buddhism, which accounts for 27.3% of the population, <BR> 
       is Sikkim's second-largest, yet most prominent religion. <BR> 
       Prior to Sikkim's becoming a part of the Indian Union, <BR> 
       Vajrayana Buddhism was the state religion under the Chogyal. <BR> 
       Sikkim has 75 Buddhist monasteries, the oldest dating back to the 1700s.<BR> 
        The public and visual aesthetics of Sikkim are executed in shades of Vajrayana<BR> 
        Buddhism and Buddhism plays a significant role in public life,<BR> 
        even among Sikkim's majority Nepali Hindu population.<BR> 
        Other religious minorities include Muslims of Bihari ethnicity and Jains,<BR> 
        who each account for roughly 1% of the population.<BR> 
        The traditional religions of the native Sikkimese account for <BR> 
       much of the remainder of the population.<BR> 
       <BR> 
       Although tensions between the Lepchas and the Nepalese escalated during the<BR> 
        merger of Sikkim with India in the 1970s, there has never been any major degree of<BR> 
        communal religious violence, unlike in other Indian states.<BR> 
        The traditional religion of the Lepcha people is Mun, an animist practice which coexists with Buddhism and Christianity.<BR>

        MERGER & STATEHOOD
    </H1><h2>
    In 1975, the Prime Minister of Sikkim appealed to the Indian Parliament for Sikkim to become a state of India.<br>
     In April of that year, the Indian Army took over the city of Gangtok and disarmed the Chogyal's palace guards.<br>
      Thereafter, a referendum was held in which 97.5 per cent of voters supported<br>
       abolishing the monarchy, effectively approving union with India.<br>
       India is said to have stationed 20,000â€“40,000 troops in a country of only 200,000 during the referendum.<br>
        On 16 May 1975, Sikkim became the 22nd state of the Indian Union, and the monarchy was abolished.<br>
         To enable the incorporation of the new state, the Indian Parliament amended the Indian Constitution.<br>
          First, the 35th Amendment laid down a set of conditions that made Sikkim an "Associate State",<br>
           a special designation not used by any other state. A month later, the 36th Amendment repealed the 35th Amendment,<br>
            and made Sikkim a full state, adding its name to the First Schedule of the Constitution.<br>

        RECENT HISTORY
    </h1>
<h2>
    
        In 2000, the seventeenth Karmapa, Urgyen Trinley Dorje,<br>
         who had been confirmed by the Dalai Lama and accepted as a tulku by the Chinese government,<br>
          escaped from Tibet, seeking to return to the Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim.<br>
           Chinese officials were in a quandary on this issue, as any protests to India would mean<br>
            an explicit endorsement of India's governance of Sikkim, which China still recognised as<br>
             an independent state occupied by India. The Chinese government eventually recognised Sikkim as an Indian state in 2003,<br>
              in return for India declaring Tibet as a "part of" the territory of China.<br>
               New Delhi had accepted Tibet as part of China way back in 1954, but China appears to have believed that the agreement had lapsed.<br>
                The 2003 agreement led to a thaw in Sino-Indian relations.<br>
                On 6 July 2006, the Sikkimese Himalayan pass of Nathu La was opened to cross-border trade,<br>
                 becoming the first open border between India and China.<br>
                 The pass, which was first opened during the 1904 Younghusband Expedition to Tibet,<br>
                  had remained closed since the 1962 Sino-Indian War.<BR>

        On 18 September 2011, a magnitude 6.9Mw earthquake struck Sikkim,<br>
         killing at least 116 people in the state and in Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Tibet.<br>
          More than 60 people died in Sikkim alone, and the city of Gangtok suffered significant damage.<br>

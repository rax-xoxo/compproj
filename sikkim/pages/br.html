<h2>
    Following the beginning of British rule in neighbouring India, <br>
    Sikkim allied with Britain against their common adversary, Nepal.<br>
    The Nepalese attacked Sikkim, overrunning most of the region including the Terai.<br> 
    This prompted the British East India Company to attack Nepal, <br>
    resulting in the Gurkha War of 1814.<br>
    Treaties signed between Sikkim and Nepal resulted<br>
    in the return of the territory annexed by the Nepalese in 1817. <br>
    However, ties between Sikkim and the British weakened<br>
    when the latter began taxation of the Morang region.<br>
    In 1849, two British physicians, Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker and Archibald Campbell,<br>
    the latter being in charge of relations between the British and Sikkimese governments,<br>
    ventured into the mountains of Sikkim unannounced and unauthorised.<br>
     The doctors were detained by the Sikkimese government,<br>
    leading to a punitive British expedition against the kingdom,<br>
    after which the Darjeeling district and Morang were annexed to British India in 1853.<br>
     The Chogyal of Sikkim became a titular ruler under the directive<br>
      of the British governor as a result of the invasion.<br>


    Sikkim became a British protectorate in the later decades of the 19th century,<br>
     formalised by a convention signed with China in 1890.<br>
     Sikkim was gradually granted more sovereignty over the next three decades,<br>
      and became a member of the Chamber of Princes,<br>
       the assembly representing the rulers of the Indian princely states, in 1922.<br>
